## Project Overview
This project focused on reducing industrial-scale food waste by developing an advanced fruit disease detection system using state-of-the-art object detection techniques.

**Duration:** June 2021 - July 2021  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Dhiraj Sangwan  

## Key Achievements

### Dataset Creation
- Created and annotated a comprehensive dataset of healthy and diseased apples through systematic web-crawling
- Ensured diverse representation of disease types and fruit conditions

### Advanced ML Implementation
- Implemented **CycleGAN** to generate synthetic images with simulated defects
- This augmentation technique significantly expanded the training dataset
- Trained robust disease detection models using the enhanced dataset

### Impact
- Developed a scalable solution to help reduce industrial-scale food waste
- Contributed to sustainable agriculture practices through early disease detection
- Demonstrated practical application of GANs in agricultural technology

## Technologies Used
- Computer Vision
- Deep Learning
- CycleGAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)
- Object Detection Algorithms
- Data Annotation and Augmentation

This project showcased the potential of machine learning in addressing real-world agricultural challenges and sustainable development goals.
