Hello! I'm Vedant Tripathi, a Systems Engineer at ARM in Bangalore, India, where I work at the fascinating intersection of hardware validation and machine learning. I'm passionate about contributing to innovative projects in System-on-Chip (SoC) development and device drivers.

## Professional Focus

Currently at ARM, I specialize in:
- **Hardware Validation**: Validating Linux payloads at multi-SoC level to ensure data concurrency and correctness
- **Driver Development**: Developing unified frameworks for bare-metal drivers to verify critical PCIe features including ATS, DMA, P2P, and MSI
- **Automation & Tools**: Engineering command line tools and web platforms to automate regression testing and provide intelligent debugging data

## Educational Background

I hold a dual degree from BITS Pilani (2019-2024):
- **B.E. Electrical and Electronics Engineering**
- **M.Sc. Physics**
- **CGPA**: 8.64/10

My academic journey included diverse coursework spanning computer programming, digital systems, microprocessors, communication systems, and computational physics, providing a strong foundation for my current work in systems engineering.

## Research Interests

My research interests center on:
- **Systems Engineering**: Focusing on hardware-software integration and validation
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Exploring ML applications in hardware validation and wireless communications
- **Electronic Materials**: Investigation of electronic band structures in perovskite materials using Density Functional Theory (DFT)

## Technical Expertise

I work with a broad range of technologies including:
- **Programming**: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, MATLAB
- **Hardware**: System Verification, SoC, ARM Architecture, Embedded Systems, Device Drivers, FPGA
- **Protocols**: UART, PCIe, DDR
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL

## Recent Achievements

- **Merit-Cum-Need Scholarship** (2019-2024): Awarded 40% tuition waiver for excellent academic performance at BITS Pilani
- **Amazon ML Summer School** (July 2022): Selected from 60,000+ applicants for a Machine Learning bootcamp
- **APAC Region Co-chair** (June 2025-Present): Leading graduate committee initiatives at ARM

I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of hardware validation, machine learning, and systems engineering. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss technology, research opportunities, or potential collaborations!
